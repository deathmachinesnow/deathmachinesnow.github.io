While on vacation in Orlando for the week back in January 2017, we hit up GatorLand,
one of Orlando's oldest parks.  It was so rad that we hit it up twice in
the same week.

We walked by the zip line area and Dougie (five years old) immediately wanted to try it.

He had no idea how high it was.
He had no idea there would be gators in the water.

This kid has never done one before - and walked up to the deck and didn't
even sweat it.

He got up there, they asked if he was ready, he said yes, and there you have it.
