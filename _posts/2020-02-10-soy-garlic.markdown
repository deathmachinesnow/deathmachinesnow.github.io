As a dad, you may have to cook some food for the kiddos by yourself sometimes.
Here's an easy recipe that can be done in less than 20 minutes.

### Ingredients

##### Meat
1.5 lbs of Flank Steak (1/2 lb. per adult person)<br/>

##### Produce
5 Cloves of garlic<br/>
Minced Garlic (if you are in a pinch)<br/>
1 Red Pepper<br/>
1 White Onion<br/>
Mushrooms<br/>

##### Sauces
Sriracha Sauce - Optional<br/>
Hoisin Sauce - Optional<br/>
Sesame Oil<br/>
1/3 cup of lite soy sauce<br/>

##### Spices
1/2 TB Sugar - Optional<br/>
Salt<br/>
Pepper<br/>

##### Rice
If you have a rice cooker, cook a cup of rice for every two people.  The
cup that came with the rice cooker, not a real measured cup.  Put in the cup
of rice, fill it with water up to the line. If you feel like playing with
fire, you'll go above or below the line.  The more you have it below the line,
the dryer the rice will be.  Above the line, will be vice versa.  Start the
rice before you cut the meat.

### Prepping Vegetables
Before you cut the meat, slice the red peppers and white onion into thin
slices.  Set it aside.

### Prepping Meat
Take the flank steak, and cut across the grain in about 1/3 inch slices.
Too thin, it'll cook too quick and overcook.  Too thick, it'll be take
a long time to cook evenly. Throw the meat into a bowl.  Take the four
cloves of garlic, smash and cut them and mix it in with the meat.

Measure the soy sauce. Take the bottle of Sriricha and squirt in the
desired amount.  Having kids that don't like things too spicy, I still
put in about five seconds worth of Srircha into the soy sauce. It provides
a decent enough of a kick without them complaining about it.

If there isn't a lot of time, throw in a table spoon of minced garlic into
the soy sauce.  Throw in some salt and pepper into the soy sauce.

Mix the sauce in with the meat. If you have time and a food sealer,
vacuum seal it.

It's optional but you could throw in some sugar into the soy sauce as well.

### Cooking
Get two pans out, one for the peppers/onion/mushrooms, one for the meat. Put a little
sesame oil in both - Medium heat for the peppers/onions.  A tad higher for
the meat.  Put in the single clove cut up into the one for the meat.

Saute the peppers/onions until they are a little soft and turn off the heat.
Toss in the meat (without the sauce mixture).  Brown both sides to seal in
the juices and cook so it's cooked medium.

When the meat is almost done, toss in the vegetables. Season with salt
and pepper as desired.

### Plate
Check the rice, it should be done now. Fluff the rice, plate the rice,
and plate the meat and vegetables.  There you have it. A simple recipe
that you can modify yourself to your liking, but the kids should like it.

If it's too spicy for their liking, just tell them to eat more rice.
