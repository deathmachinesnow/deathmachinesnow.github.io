On a weekend vacation to Deep Creek, the kids were looking forward
to the Mountain Coaster and the Chipmunk Challenge.  The cousins had a
good time with the High Five pass and a couple Mountain Coaster Double passes.

We typically go in October in between seasons so it's a fun time to go,
not much of a crowd, and decent enough weather to go out and do things.
The guides were very encouraging.
