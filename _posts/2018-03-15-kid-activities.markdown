So we picked up a membership at the local Ninja Warrior training facility,
since it beats the aftercare (school).  Watching the kid learn on his own
without any kind of coaching has been as a treasure to watch. This is maybe
his third try of the day - maybe 15 times today overall from all of his
visits. His determination is pretty impressive here and I just follow
him around and give him encouragement - maybe time him if he wants me to.
Watch him climb the Augmented Wall - super fun to watch him.
