My wife was sick so this kiddo wanted to make pancake for her.

NO HELP FROM DAD!   He really wanted to make breakfast for mom last night...
Entrusting your kid to stand behind the range / not burn himself is definitely
something new at age five (especially when you have the heat a tad too high)...
Next step is teaching him how to make stir fry so I can sit and watch tv after work.
